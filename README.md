# EMM_RCS

This repository contains the code for the experiments in the manuscript "Exceptional Model Mining for Repeated Cross-Sectional Data (EMM-RCS)", submitted to the International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) on June 12, 2021. 

Apart from all scripts, there are 2 folders:

- data_output: contains the code and results of all experiments and figures
- data_input: contains the scripts for reading and processing all data, including the public datasets.

The experiments can be run using main.py. 

Let me know if things are unclear and reach out to me if you have any questions.

Bests,
