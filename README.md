# EMM_RCS

This repository contains the code for the experiments in the manuscript `', submitted to the International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) on June 12, 2021. 

Apart from all scripts, there are 2 folders:

- data_output: contains the code and results of all experiments and figures
- data_input: contains the scripts for reading and processing all data, including the public datasets.

The experiments can be run using main.py. 
Script import_subgroup.py can be used to create the figures using the R scripts in the data_output folder.

Let me know if things are unclear and reach out to me if you have any questions.

Bests,
